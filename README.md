## TODO
* Show "First half of the day" / "Second half of the day" so that we don't have
  to guess
* If the text entry field is wrong when the Go button is pressed, highlight that
  somehow. When the user starts editing the field, remove the highlight.
* Show "First half of the day" / "Second half of the day"
* Enable the Go button and text field entry only when the text field contains a
  valid (although not necessarily correct) time
* Set up CI for deploying to GitHub pages
* Refocus text field after user presses Enter or clicks the Go! button
* Test it on somebody
* ...

### DONE

  new time on the analog clock and clear the field
